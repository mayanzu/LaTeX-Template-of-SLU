Design and implementation of a 2D side-scrolling adventure game using the Unity development engine}

\noindent\textbf{Abstract}: Game development is a field rich in innovation and creativity, providing a unique opportunity for creative expression in design, graphics, audio, programming, and more. It encompasses various disciplines including computer science, art design, audio engineering, among others. Therefore, selecting game development as a thesis topic can promote interdisciplinary learning and collaboration. Through researching and practicing game development, one can apply technical knowledge to real projects and emphasize user experience, including game fluency, interactivity, and immersion, providing interesting case studies for user experience design and research. 2D side-scrolling adventure games are a classic genre loved by many players. These games are simple, easy to understand, and offer diverse gameplay, providing players with rich adventure experiences. 

Unity engine offers powerful 2D game development tools, and its integration with deep learning and natural language processing technologies is relatively straightforward. Using Unity engine, it's relatively easy to create 2D side-scrolling adventure games. Through writing this thesis, a practical case study can be provided to better grasp the application techniques of Unity engine and encounter and solve various technical challenges along the way. The research content of this thesis includes game concept design, art resource preparation, game interface design, level design, game programming development, testing, and optimization.
